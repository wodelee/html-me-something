		<h4>How it all EB(-3)gan</h4>
		<body><p>Grade 3 students at Garfield Elementary were given music aptitude tests and I scored in the 'trumpet' range. Beginning in Grade 4, I was taking trumpet lessons. Soon, it was decided my embouchure wasn't correct so I was moved down through the brass family, ending up playing tuba by the middle of Grade 5.</p><p>The orchestra leader decided he could use me as well, and began giving me upright bass lessons.  Excelling at both, by grade 7 I was a member of all-star orchestras and concert bands.</p>
		<h4>The Influences</h4><p>Yes, David Bowie, Pink Floyd, Rush, Genesis, Led Zeppelin, The Who, Jethro Tull, Deep Purple...bands of my youth.  These were among the bands that inspired me to expand my musical endeavors into rock and the energy in encompasses.  Unlike my friends who all want to be lead guitarists and drummers, the thumping, pulsating heart of the music called to me.  <img src="file:///Users/newuser/Documents/lc101/html-me-something/images/EB3-nw.png" height="200" align="right" hspace="30" vspace = "30" >Bass, that was where it was for me.</p><p>But what to play?  I hit the local music store, a short 65 minute bicycle ride away, and looked at a Gibson Grabber, a model Gibson Gene Simmons of Kiss played.  I wasn't impressed with the instrument, but liked the Gibson's tonality.  I kept looking and found a used 1963 Gibson EB-3.  Saving all my paper route money, lawn mowing money and every other penny I could, I finally had enough money to buy the beauty.  From there, rock and roll stardom was assured!</p></n>
		<h4>The Bands</h4><p>With this beautiful bass, and a tremendously powerful Acoustic amp, it was time for a band.  Dan, a buddy of mine who is an amazing musician, played lead on a blonde Gibson SG, the same body as my bass.  He brought friends Jon and Bill who played drums and keys, and Carrera was born!  Mom and Dad put up with us practicing in the basement as I didn't drive (yet) and no other family would <img src="file:///Users/newuser/Documents/lc101/html-me-something/images/Carrera.png" height="200" align="left" hspace="30">put up with the volume.</p><p>After our first gig, it became clear we needed a rhythm guitarist, Brian, a talented guitarist who had a 1956 Gibson Les Paul, the Holy Grail of guitars!  And so it we played for a couple years until the older guys went to college.<img src="file:///Users/newuser/Documents/lc101/html-me-something/images/Bric.png"height="100" align="right" vspace="30"></p><h4/>A Band Called...</h4>Having some experience, and wanting to emulate my musical heros, Geddy Lee and Chris Squire, I bought a Rickenbacher 4001  but had no where to play.  Gigging with bands from time to time, I met David, lead guitar, who introduced Mike on drums and rhythm guitarist Jim.  This line up was the next 'permanent' band.  As a quartet, what better name than FourPlay?	And that Rick was a huge changer from the Gibson that I started with.  After about a year, we added Rich on sax, a couple 80's power female singers and the name no longer made sense for a seven piece band.  Arriving late to practice one evening, I was told the band voted to change the name to Thrasher.  Dad was so proud....<img src="file:///Users/newuser/Documents/lc101/html-me-something/images/Thrasher.jpg"height="150"align="left"></p><n/><h4>The Aftermath</h4><p>Thrasher continued to play for a couple years, with various personnel changes.  Mick left and was replaced by Dave, Jim left for greener pastures and was replaced by Marty on rhythm and vocals, the girls left and joined other groups and we picked up a keyboardist, Bill.  As the band changed, so did our catalog, moving from the break-out female-lead bands that changed rock in the 80's to a more Southern rock and heavy rock combination.  After another year or so, Thrasher's members went our separate ways.  I headed to Boston and audio engineering at Berklee.  During my first semester, my Rick was stolen (the one pictured here is a replacement I bought some 25 years later).  Thankfully, the EB-3 was a great backup.</p> 	<h4>Feeding the Addiction</h4><p>After Berklee, <img src="file:///Users/newuser/Documents/lc101/html-me-something/images/K403.jpg"height="100"align="left"hspace="30">I drifted away from music.  The Berklee experience taught my the music business was much more about the politics of music and much less about the art of music.  Playing was becoming more of a hobby at home, and much less of a communal experience like back in the band days.  I eventually began to pick up additional basses, guitars and other equipment, <img src="file:///Users/newuser/Documents/lc101/html-me-something/images/K-HE.jpg"height="100"align="right"hspace="20">with the intent or recording original material I had written over the years.  I bought a collection of Kramers from a guy in California.  I always wanted a Kramer, but couldn't afford one back in my starving artist period.  Kramers are unique in that they have an aluminum neck, giving them other-worldly sustain and a different tonality and feel than an all wood instrument.</p><p>Bassists such as Stanley Clarke of Weather Report and John Entwistle of The Who played Alembic basses.  Jerry Garcia also played Alembic guitars.  Kramers had been out of my financial reach earlier in my life, and Alembics were reserved for the top pros.  But as my collection grew and means improved, I decided it was time.  I found an amazing Alembic Europa six string (standard bass guitars are four string) at a great price. <img src="file:///Users/newuser/Documents/lc101/html-me-something/images/Europa.png"height="100"hspace="20"align="left"> </p><p>I added more Alembics and eventually an instrument I had fallen in love with the first time I saw Peter Gabriel, a Chapman Stick.  Designed by mathematician Emmet Chapman, the Stick is a fret board instrument played by tapping strings against the frets, rather than strumming or plucking, like a traditional guitar. <img src="file:///Users/newuser/Documents/lc101/html-me-something/images/stick.png" height="75"align="right">Tony Levin, Peter Gabriel's bassist as well as a member of King Crimson, plays a Stick. When I purchased it, I discovered Tony Levin's stick teacher lived on Long Island, about an hour from where I lived, so I went to Long Island for lessons.</p><p>Adding a 16 channel Yamaha board, a 500 watt Hartke stereo amplifier, Moog Taurus II bass pedals, various effects racks and pedals, Sunn cabinets, a couple guitars including a guitar by Lightwave Technologies and some other toys, I was ready to go.  Lightwave developed a pickup system that utilizes lasers, rather than magnets, to sense string vibrations.  Because there is no magnetic interference with the string vibration, the pickups do not change the string oscillations, allowing for truer sounds and sustain.</p><p>So with the best intentions, I set up a studio in an unused room of the house, and recorded absolutely nothing.  Life got in the way as I began to travel in three and four month chunks and there simply wasn't time for recording that hit song.  Eventually, I began to thin the herd and am down to about 10 instruments from a high of about 40.  They are missed.   	</body>
